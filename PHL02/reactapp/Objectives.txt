React Life Cycle - Pure Components

React normally re-renders a component whenever its parent re-renders. As an optimization, you can create a component that React will not re-render when its parent re-renders so long as its new props and state are the same as the old props and state. Class components can opt into this behavior by extending PureComponent
PureComponent is a subclass of Component and supports all the Component APIs. Extending PureComponent is equivalent to defining a custom shouldComponentUpdate method that shallowly compares props and state.
Program:
Convert App component to pure component. That returns greeting message 'WELCOME' with one of the props name.
In App component, Add one textbox for entering Name and one button to increment the AGE.
set the default name: IamNEO and age: 15
App.js has code. Convert App Component to pure component.
This component re-renders whenever the name changed.

Lab Environment

In the project environment, there are two folders.

a. react - react folder is the read-only folder and has the project's test cases.

b. reactapp â€“ explore your code in this folder. you can use it for coding.

Default settings mapped to run the frontend application in PORT-8081:

The package.json file in reactapp folder is modified as: (Note -If not you can change it as below)

"scripts": {

"start": "PORT=8081 react-scripts start",

"build": "react-scripts build",

"test": "react-scripts test",

"eject": "react-scripts eject"}

 

To run the application:

 

Open the terminal - From Menu bar, select Terminal, then Open Terminal

 

Type the below commands to execute the react project

 

cd reactapp - command to open the folder

 

nvm use 14 - command to select the node version to 14

 

npm install - command to add the packages
[All packages are declared within package.json file]

 

npm start - command to run the application in PORT 8081
